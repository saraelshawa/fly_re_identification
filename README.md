Example use-cases:

1. To train a resnet18 model on replicate-1 (present in pic_dir) using 'random cropping + masking' data augmentation, run:
```
python train_network.py --descriptor test --pic_dir </path/to/3DayData> --replicate 1 -d r_crop_mask --log_path </path/to/logs> --chkpoint_path </path/to/checkpoints> 
```
Note: The output is logged in the 'log_path' directory, and checkpoints are saved in the path given by 'chkpoint_path', and the name which is used in both cases is given by the 'descriptor' you specify

2. To test the above network on day-2 fly images of replicate-1, run:
```
python test_network.py --pic_dir </path/to/3DayData> --replicate 1 --day Day2 --chkpoint_path </path/to/checkpoints> --chkpoint_name test
```

3. To perform double day training (DDT) using 'random masking' data augmentation, run:
```
python train_network.py --descriptor test --pic_dir </path/to/3DayData> --replicate 1 --ddt true -d r_mask --log_path </path/to/logs> --chkpoint_path </path/to/checkpoints> 
```

4. To train domain adversarial networks on replicate-3 without any data augmentation, run:
```
python dann_train.py --descriptor test --pic_dir </path/to/3DayData> --replicate 3 --log_path </path/to/logs> --chkpoint_path </path/to/checkpoints>
```

5. To test the above trained domain adversarial network on Day-3 of replicate-3, run:
```
python dann_test.py --pic_dir </path/to/3DayData> --replicate 3 --day Day3 --chkpoint_path </path/to/checkpoints> --chkpoint_name test
```
